Description
===========

This cookbook will install [sbt-extras](https://github.com/paulp/sbt-extras), an alternative script for running [sbt](https://github.com/harrah/xsbt). sbt-extras works with sbt 0.7.x projects as well as 0.10+. If you're in an sbt project directory, the runner will figure out the versions of sbt and scala required by the project and download them if necessary.

The **default** recipe of this Chef cookbook will:

* Download and install the sbt-extras script (e.g. from a github commit/branch/tag) 
* Potentially grant some (or even all) users to download/install on demand the required sbt/scala versions.
* Optionally trigger the installation of some sbt/scala dependencies for specific users (see the *'Optional Attributes'* section below)

Requirements
============

* Depends on **opscode/java** cookbook
* Conflicts with **gildegoma/typesafe-stack** cookbook

Attributes
==========

* `node['sbt-extras']['download_url']` - URL to obtain a specific version of sbt-extras script  
* `node['sbt-extras']['setup_dir']` - Target directory for installation (default: `/opt/sbt-extras`)
* `node['sbt-extras']['script_name']` - Name of the installed script (default: `sbt`).
* `node['sbt-extras']['owner']` - user owner of installed resources (default: `root`)
* `node['sbt-extras']['group']` - group owner of installed resources (default: `sbt`). **Important:** Members of this group are granted to auto-download/setup on demand any missing versions of sbt (setgid flag is set on `node['sbt-extras']['setup_dir']/.lib` and download files are ``002` umasked.
* `node['sbt-extras']['group_new_members']` - Members of `node['sbt-extras']['group']`, *to be appended if the group already exists*.
* `node['sbt-extras']['sbtopts']['mem']` - sbt-extras `-mem <mem>` is used when executing sbt script during chef provisioning. This parameter is also used when installing `/etc/sbt/sbtopts` template

## Optional Attributes

* `node['sbt-extras']['bin_symlink']` - sbt-extras script will be linked from this location, *only if this attribute is defined!* (enabled by default to: `/usr/bin/sbt`)
* `node['sbt-extras']['sbtopts_filename']` - Template filename of global sbtopts file (default: `'sbtopts'`), The template won't be installed if the filename is an empty string (`''`)
* `node['sbt-extras']['jvmopts_filename']` - Template filename of global jvmopts file (default: `''`). The template won't be installed if the filename is an empty string (`''`)
* `node['sbt-extras']['preinstall_matrix'][<user_name>][<sbt_version>][<scala_versions]` - Matrix of sbt/scala versions to pre-install during chef provisioning. Examples: 

```ruby
node['sbt-extras']['preinstall_matrix']['old_geek']['0.10.1']     = %w{ 2.8.2 2.8.1 }
node['sbt-extras']['preinstall_matrix']['old_geek']['0.11.3']     = %w{ 2.9.2 2.8.2 }
node['sbt-extras']['preinstall_matrix']['old_geek']['0.12.1']     = %w{ 2.10.0-RC2 2.9.2 2.9.1 2.9.0-1 }
node['sbt-extras']['preinstall_matrix']['scala_hacker']['0.12.1'] = %w{ 2.10.0-RC2 }
```
